# Fingerprint Recognition AlexNet
This is my attempt at finger recognition using the AlexNet model working on two different datasets. The fingerprint recognition project utilizing AlexNet involves developing a deep learning model to accurately identify and authenticate individuals based on their fingerprints. The project aims to enhance security systems, access control, and forensic investigations by leveraging the power of convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and the AlexNet architecture specifically.
